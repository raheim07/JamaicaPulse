🧠 “Pulse of the Nation” — Real-Time Sentiment Dashboard

Goal:
To visualize Jamaica’s real-time emotional state — based on aggregated public online discussions — in a safe, insightful, and visually engaging way.

🎯 Core Problem

Decision-makers, journalists, and even citizens have no real-time way to measure what Jamaicans are feeling about current issues (inflation, crime, politics, etc.).

Existing global sentiment tools don’t understand Caribbean English or Patois, which skews results.
We solve this by training a localized NLP model that understands how Jamaicans speak and express emotion.

🌟 Solution Summary

A web-based Sentiment Intelligence Dashboard that:

Collects and cleans public social data (from X, YouTube, Reddit, news comments).

Runs it through a Jamaican-aware sentiment model.

Displays the nation’s collective mood across topics, time, and regions.

🧠 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
🩵 Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation

Goal: Gather public posts for analysis.

Use APIs (X/Twitter, Reddit, YouTube) filtered by:

Country (Jamaica)

Relevant keywords: “gas prices”, “crime”, “government”, “JUTC”, “dancehall”, etc.

Clean data:

Remove URLs, hashtags, emojis (except emotional ones).

Remove personal identifiers (usernames, handles).

Language filter (English + Jamaican Patois).

Store raw data temporarily (CSV or MongoDB).

💬 Phase 2: Sentiment Model Development

Goal: Create a model that understands Jamaican dialect.

Use a pre-trained model:

Base: bert-base-uncased or distilbert-base-uncased.

Fine-tune using a custom dataset with:

Labeled Jamaican social media posts.

Data augmentation (e.g., translate slang → English).

Classes:

Positive 😄

Negative 😡

Neutral 😐

Optional: Joy / Anger / Fear / Optimism

Evaluate with F1 score and accuracy.

🧮 Phase 3: Aggregation & Storage

Goal: Store only safe, summarized insights.

After analysis, aggregate by:

Region (if location available)

Topic keyword

Emotion type

Store:

{
  "topic": "crime",
  "positive": 0.25,
  "negative": 0.65,
  "neutral": 0.10,
  "region": "Kingston",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T10:00Z"
}


✅ No personal data stored.

🧠 Phase 4: API Development

Goal: Serve data to frontend.

Endpoints (FastAPI):

GET /api/pulse          → Returns latest national sentiment index.
GET /api/topics          → Returns top trending topics & emotions.
GET /api/regions         → Returns sentiment by parish.
GET /api/trends          → Returns sentiment over time.

🌈 Phase 5: Frontend Dashboard (React)
🏠 Home Page

Pulse Index Card:
Big number showing overall national sentiment.
Example: Pulse Index 68 — “Optimistic”

Trend Graph:
Line chart of national sentiment over 24 hours or 7 days.

Heatmap:
Map of Jamaica with parish-level mood intensity (Mapbox).

Top 5 Topics Widget:
Small cards showing emotions by category.

📊 Topic Insights Page

Dropdown filter (Economy, Crime, Education, etc.)

Bar/Donut chart of emotions by topic.

Trend line of sentiment for that topic.

🌎 Regional Pulse Page

Interactive heatmap (hover shows stats per parish).

Sidebar with “Most Positive” and “Most Concerned” regions.

📘 About Page

Infographic of data pipeline.

Transparency section explaining:

Only public data.

All anonymized and aggregated.

Focused on emotional trends, not individuals.

🔒 Privacy & Ethics Layer

Only aggregate emotions — no usernames, IDs, or raw posts.

Summaries are generated by AI — no quotes from real users.

Filters detect spam, hate speech, and bots.

Transparency disclaimer:
“This dashboard analyzes public data for research and awareness. It does not represent official statistics.”

🚀 Phase 6: Deployment

Host backend (FastAPI) on Render or Railway.

Host frontend (React) on Vercel or Netlify.

Schedule sentiment updates every hour (using cron job).

Add real-time simulation (if live API data is limited during hackathon).

🎁 Extra (For Hackathon Wow Factor)

Add an AI-generated daily summary:

“Today, Jamaicans are feeling hopeful about education reform, but concerns about inflation remain high in Kingston.”

Add a compare tab:

Compare mood “This Week vs. Last Week”.

Add a Mood Forecast — short-term prediction based on trendline.
